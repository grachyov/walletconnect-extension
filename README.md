# WalletConnect Bridge

> Use your WalletConnect wallet on sites where only MetaMask is supported.

This extension injects the WalletConnect web3 provider similarly to how MetaMask does it, allowing you to connect a WalletConnect wallet on pages where only injected providers are supported.

## Installation

I've submitted this extension to the Chrome Web Store, and am planning to submit it to the App Store as well (which should allow you to use it from your iPhone/iPad with iOS 15!) once I figure out the best way of doing that. Once they approve it, I'll post the links here.

## Development

- Clone the repository
- `yarn install && yarn build`
- Visit `chrome://extensions` on your Chromium browser, make sure developer mode is enabled, click _Load Unpacked_ & navigate to this repo.
